# DataAnalysis_Chicago-s-crime_data2021

Introduction :


In practically every nation, crime is rising quickly. Analyzing many aspects of crime and 
identifying criminal trends are highly important. Security agencies throughout the world are 
working hard to lower these crimes, but the volume of crime data is growing quickly, making it 
challenging to handle such a large amount of data and to maintain records of crimes that occur 
over a vast geographic area and over a variety of time periods. Therefore, having a criminal 
information system that can analyze a lot of data quickly is essential. Also, one of the most efficient 
techniques to explore, analyze, find patterns, and forecast future crimes in a vast quantity of data 
is data analysis by using clustering, classification, and association mining.
